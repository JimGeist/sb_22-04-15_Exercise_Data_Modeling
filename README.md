## Assignment Details
### Part 1: Schema Design
Schema Designs for a Medical Center, Craigslist, and a Soccer League. I will come back to these another time. 


### Part 2: Schema Critique
Best description of the exercise is normalization of data contained in one table. Schemas were for 'outer_space', 'air_traffic', and 'music'. Thankfully, music did not delve into song writers!

The interesting thing is when tables become normalized and duplicate information is reduced, queries typically become complicated since multiple joins are often needed to produce the same output. The air_traffic example, shows a bit why there is a wait to get information back when you are at an airport kiosk or the 'system is slow' comment when booking a trip because many inserts and/or updates are occurring across many tables in a massive system accessed by thousands of people.

The queries were uploaded as part of this exercise.


### DIFFICULTIES 
Going overboard!
